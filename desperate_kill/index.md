# Desperate: Kill!

"Desperate: Kill!" is basically a top-view shoot'em up, similar to ["Rambo III"](https://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&num=1759).

I intend visuals to be pixel-art like, low-res (think of 320x240) screen, with 8x8 sprites, even for characters. "LibreSprite" should be of great use both for creating such sprites and animating them.

## Game mechanics

Visually, the tricky part is the art one. Sprites are not that challenging to display, only to create.

Levels will be generated, making each new game unique. Adding some narration would be interesting and kinda challenging to be relevant. An Half-Life-like introduction would definitely be a killer!

That game can be very fun if done correctly, gameplay is well-known.
